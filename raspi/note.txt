no wireless interfaces found
this indicates wireless driver is `not working`

solution:go to /etc/network/interfaces.d and check whether the configs contains below
```
auto wlan0              // crutial without it the wifi module won't work
allow-hotplug wlan0     //the same crutial
iface eth0 inet manual  //idk why,in my case,wlan0 won't work when this set to dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf  //hot point configrations
```

at last don't forget to config ip,route,dns
